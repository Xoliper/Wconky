# Configuration + Stability

Please, configure your "config.xml" file with included editor and be SURE that everything is filled (and with a valid data/paths) because when I wrote this code, I did not handle any errors (it was just a project to pass the course and it was supposed to just work)...

# Support
The project is quite old and therefore abandoned (I am ashamed to look at this code after years), but the binary works. Tested on Intel and nVidia cards.
